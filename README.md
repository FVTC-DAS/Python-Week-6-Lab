# Week 6 Lab: Lists and f-strings

The goal of this lab is to get hands-on practice with the fundamental operations of creating, accessing, modifying, and iterating over Python lists.

## How to Use This Repository (GitHub Classroom)

1. Accept the Classroom assignment link and clone the repo to your computer.
2. Open the repository in VS Code.
3. Open **week6_lab.ipynb** and complete the tasks in the designated cells.
4. Run all cells to verify your outputs.
5. Save, then **commit** and **push** your changes back to GitHub.

## Tasks

Complete the single Jupyter Notebook named **week6_lab.ipynb**. Each task should be in its own cell or set of cells.

### Task 1: Create and Access

* Create a list named `favorite_foods` that contains three of your favorite foods as strings.
* Print the entire list.
* Print the item at index 0 of the list.
* Print the item at index 2 of the list.

### Task 2: Modify and Append

* Using the same `favorite_foods` list, change the item at index 1 to a different food.
* Use the `.append()` method to add a fourth food to the end of the list.
* Print the final, modified list.

### Task 3: Loop and Print with an f-string

* Using the final version of your `favorite_foods` list, write a `for` loop.
* Inside the loop, use an f-string to print each food on a new line, formatted like this: `I like to eat: pizza`.
